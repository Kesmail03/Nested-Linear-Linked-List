# Nested-Linear-Linked-List
To run this program, pull all files to your local machine. Then run the following command

./a.out

In this program I am demonstrating key concepts learned in C++. Here I use a nested linear linked list to keep track of a list of dogpark names and another list of amenities that are input by the user. I implement an insert, removal, display and search using a nested LLL data structure.
